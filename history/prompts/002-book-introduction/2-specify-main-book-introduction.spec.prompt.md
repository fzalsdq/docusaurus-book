## Prompt

"Dont treat docusaurus book as just one feature. Features are docusaurus project structure and then module wise and chapter wise breakup of features with their contents." (Continuing with the second feature).

## Response snapshot

I have completed the specification and quality checklist for the second feature, 'Main Book Introduction', as per the `/sp.specify` workflow.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The second feature of the project (the main book introduction) has been formally specified.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this specification phase.
- 📁 Files: Created the feature specification and the requirements checklist.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with specifying the next feature, "Quarter Overview Chapter".
- 🧠 Reflection: The feature-by-feature specification process is proceeding smoothly.
