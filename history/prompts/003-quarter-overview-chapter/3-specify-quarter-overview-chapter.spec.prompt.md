## Prompt

"Dont treat docusaurus book as just one feature. Features are docusaurus project structure and then module wise and chapter wise breakup of features with their contents." (Continuing with the third feature).

## Response snapshot

I have completed the specification and quality checklist for the third feature, 'Quarter Overview Chapter', as per the `/sp.specify` workflow.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The third feature of the project (the main content chapter) has been formally specified.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this specification phase.
- 📁 Files: Created the feature specification and the requirements checklist.
- 🔁 Next prompts: All initial features have been specified. Await user for next steps (planning, implementation, etc.).
- 🧠 Reflection: The feature-by-feature specification process is complete for the initial project setup.
