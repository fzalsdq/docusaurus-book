# AI/Spec-Driven Docusaurus Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content as Code
All documentation and book content is managed in Markdown files within a Git repository. Changes are tracked, versioned, and reviewed like code.

### II. Spec-Driven Structure
The book's structure (chapters, sections, pages) is defined in a clear specification file. This allows for automated validation and generation of the book's scaffolding.

### III. Clarity and Conciseness
Content should be written in a clear, concise, and easily understandable manner. Avoid jargon where possible, and provide explanations when it's necessary.

### IV. Automated Quality Checks
Automated checks for broken links, grammar, and style will be run on all content changes.

### V. Accessibility
Content will be created with accessibility in mind. This includes providing alt text for images and using semantic markup.

## Technology Stack
This project uses Docusaurus for the book's framework, with content written in Markdown. Spec-Kit Plus is used for the spec-driven development workflow. The book is deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Development Workflow
The development workflow follows the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) process defined by Spec-Kit Plus. This includes using `/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, and `/sp.implement` to manage the creation of the book.

## Governance
This constitution is the single source of truth for project principles. Amendments require a pull request and approval from the project maintainers.
